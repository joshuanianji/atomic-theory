# Atomic Theory Project 

We were supposed to make a project in physics showcasing a timeline of the atomic theory. I decided to code it up :PP

## Online

You can run the code on my website: [https://joshuaji.com/projects/atomic-models/](https://joshuaji.com/projects/atomic-models/)

## Offline

If you want to run it on your own computer for whatever reason, make sure you have the [Elm Language](https://elm-lang.org/) installed. I used [elm-live](https://www.elm-live.com/) for the development server and it's kinda useful so you should install it as well.

Once you have everything installed you can just run `elm-live src/Main.elm --open -- --output=elm.js` in the root folder.
