# Atomic Theory Project

A short history of the Atomic Model, created for my Grade 12 Physics class.

## Online

You can see the website on this link: [https://joshuaji.com/projects/atomic-models/](https://joshuaji.com/projects/atomic-models/)

## Offline

If you want to run it on your own computer for whatever reason, make sure you have the [Elm Language](https://elm-lang.org/) installed. I used [elm-live](https://www.elm-live.com/) for the development server.

Once you have everything installed you can just run `elm-live src/Main.elm --open -- --output=elm.js` in the root folder.
